# Work Day Scheduler 

## Description
This project is a simple work day scheduler designed to assist an employee with planning their work day to better manage their time. Users will be able to add text detailing their desired tasks, appointments, deadlines, etc. by the hour. By hitting the save button, users can save the provided event text to their device's local storage, making the application an effective personal scheduler that can be re-visited/re-used. 
This planner utilizes the Day.js library to dynamically update the page's HTML and CSS based off of the user's current date & time. The page is organized with color-coding to improve readability. It was developed as an exercise in saving/receiving data from local storage, employing the use of third-party-APIs, and DOM traversal. 
The starter code can be found here: [Work Day Scheduler Starter Code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/crispy-octo-meme).

## Usage
This gif provided with the starter code demonstrates the page's functionality. By clicking into a timeblock, the user will be able to add/edit the event text to their liking. After doing so, the light blue save button will save their text to their device. Timeblocks colored in grey represent the past. Timeblocks colored in red represent the present. Timeblocks colored in green represent the future.
